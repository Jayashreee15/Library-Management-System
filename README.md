 ðŸ“š Library Management System (Java OOP Project)

 ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This project is part of the *Java Developer Internship Task 3*.
The aim is to build a **mini Library Management System** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Java.

It demonstrates key OOP concepts:

* **Encapsulation** â€“ private fields with getters/setters
* **Abstraction** â€“ Library hides internal details
* **Inheritance & Polymorphism** â€“ easily extendable for future enhancements
 ðŸ›  Tools & Prerequisites

* Java (JDK 8 or higher)
* Any IDE (IntelliJ / VS Code / Eclipse) or terminal
* Git (optional, for version control)

* Issue a book to a user
* Return a book
* Track issued books per user

This project consists of four Java files:

* `Book.java`
* `User.java`
* `Library.java`
* `Main.java`
